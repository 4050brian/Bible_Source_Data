# Bible_Source_Data

Source data used to create this database/s. All source data used to create the database(seeing this is the object of this project) will be uploaded here.

These files are mostly text, xml, json, html format but there are some exceptions like excel spreadsheet format. The process of creating scipts to import these files into a database format will be explained with template scripts used for these purposes. The current database formats are mySql and Microsoft Sql. These will be updated regularly as new Bible versions are added.

The Bible database format will be discussed in the attached document or for more please visit:
